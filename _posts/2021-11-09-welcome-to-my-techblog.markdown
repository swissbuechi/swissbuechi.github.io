Welcome to my techblog. I'm a Software Developer and System Engineer from Switzerland and this is my introduction.

## About me

I love information technology and everything involved. I was about ten years old when my father first handed
me an old laptop and said "Install linux on it", I was like "what does that even mean?"
He told me that this was an alternative to Microsoft Windows. I was already playing little games on my fathers 
Windows PC. So he figured out it would be a great idea if I had something to play on myself.

After we got Linux Mint 9.04 up and running on the old laptop, everything happening
next was already carved in stone.

I was installing software, downloading files & surfing the internet like it was the last day on this
planet. I got addicted to technology. I wanted to be able to do everything on my laptop. It was
a matter of time till I destroyed the whole operating system and could not boot my machine anymore.
I ran to my father, and he again helped me to set everything up. After the first login on my revived
device I realized that everything I collected over the last few weeks was gone. After that day, never in my
life have I ever worked with some kind of file with no backup.

In the following years I was not really focusing my skills on something specific. My goal was just
to have fun with everything related to information technology.

The next big step was my iPod touch which I got from my godfather at the age of twelve. Very quickly I
realised that I need my fathers credit card to be able to download all the apps everyone was talking about.
Thank god my father never even spent a single penny for me in the app store. I needed a solution.
"jailbreak" what even is this? I and a childhood friend of mine dug out my dusty old linux machine
and started trying to "jailbreak" our iPods till we finally got the magic app called "cydia" to show up
on our iOS 4 home screens.

## Current jobs

I'm currently working full-time as IT-Specialist at [Dreikom AG](https://dreikom.ch).
My main tasks involve building and managing hybrid and cloud environments for our customers.

On the system engineering side I complete tasks like:
Migrating workloads like e-mail and file shares to the cloud, building policies to enforce settings on clients
and servers, rollout client software, managing operating system and application updates, configure and deploy network 
devices like firewall and switches, monitoring customer devices and services, setting up backups of servers and
cloud workloads.

This is just a brief overview of my current tasks as system engineer.

There are also software engineering tasks involved like: Writing PowerShell scripts to automate simple things,
developing business applications to automate complex time worthy tasks, creating ci/cd pipelines to deploy 
applications.
